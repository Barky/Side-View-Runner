# Side-View-Runner

This game is my very first Unity project.

I influenced and got these assets from a Udemy course but i could not find it to reference.

I developed and built for Android. 

It's a very simple game actually. There is a Main Menu and a procedural generated endless level. Left Button is for shooting, Right button is for jumping and double-jumping in the air.

You can increase your health by taking collectibles. 

You need to avoid the monsters and monsters bullets.

LEVEL UI means your high score. I could not find a UI for high score that fits on the game.

You can close and open soundtrack music only in the main menu.

Options section in the main menu is COPYRIGHT page and it contains my pic and github url.
